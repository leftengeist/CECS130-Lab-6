### Programming assignment (100 pts): Write a program that uses an array of structures to hold contact information for your friends. The program should allow the user to enter as many friends as the user wants. Create functions to add or delete entries in the phone book and to print valid phone book entries. Do not display phone book entries that are invalid or NULL (0). You can assume that all people have unique names. Make sure you allocate and free memory as necessary.
